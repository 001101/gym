# Benchmark Viewer

View a benchmark
```
cd gym/benchmarks/viewer
./view_benchmark.py /tmp/Atari40M --open
```

Tests live in scoreboard directory, run them with
```
pytest ../../scoreboard/
```

In development, run with --debug to get a debugger
```
./view_benchmark.py /tmp/Atari40M --debug
```

# Data

The important information about the performance of each evaluation lives in the batch stats e.g. `openaigym.episode_batch.0.7.stats.json`

benchmark-specific data lives in `benchmark_run_data.yaml`
